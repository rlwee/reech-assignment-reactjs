                <p>"Why cant we have a safer way to hail a ride?" <br></br>

                    "What if we could make life a little bit easier"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Okay, it started with several questions. Those questions led to a group of incredibly <br></br>
                    ambitious (and incredibly optimistic) friends starting this company in a tiny rented  <br></br>
                    storage space somehwere in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That was in 2012.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, that tiny company has turned into Grab, Southeast Asia's largest mobile <br></br>
                    technology company that connects millions of consumers to millions of drivers, <br></br>
                    merchants, and businesses. Grab is taing on the largest problems that affect the <br></br>
                    region, including access inequality, outdated infrastructure, and income disparity. <br></br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Just like every single Southeast Asian, we're still incredibly ambitious. We're still <br></br>
                    questioning those everyday limitations. And we're still incredibly optimistic.
